# SQL
Using advanced SQL to query information from Snowflake or SQL server for faculty requests
I am familiar with subqueries, common table expression (CTE), window functions, aggregation in SQL.

This SQL repository contains two projects that I work as an Institutional Research Analyst at Southeast Missouri State University: 

I. Project 1: English Foundation Courses Report for English department using SQL on Snowflake and Excel pivot table
  1. What percentage of students getting only DFW (D grade, F grade, Withdraw) in EN100 and EN140 among all their courses taken in a semester?
  2. What percentage of these students received a less than C (which means DFW grade) in all their courses?
  3. What percentage of these students retake the course and then complete their degree? 

II. Project 2: Admission Comparision Report for Office of Admission using SQL on Visual Studio and SQL Server Reporting Service (SSRS): 
  1. What is the daily change in admission and enrollment for undergraduate by college, department, major between today semester and the same day of last year?
  2. What is the daily change in admission and enrollment for undergraduate by college, department, major, campus between today semester and the same day of last year?
  3. What is the daily change in admission and enrollment for undergraduate by college, department, major, citizenship between today semester and the same day of last year?
  4. What is the daily change in admission and enrollment for undergraduate by college, department, major, student type between today semester and the same day of last year?
